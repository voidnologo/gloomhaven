You return to your rooms for the evening to find a small note resting on the ground in front of your door.

It is from the Tinkerer, explaining that he has been pursuing further studies in flammable liquid delivery
methods.  He asks for your help in delivering to him a small robotic contraption that he absentmindedly
left behind in a secret stash under the floorboards of this old room.

He details the device's location and gives an address to deliver it to -- some small villiage far to the
northeast.

## Option A

Oblige the Tinkerer and send along the contraption.

## Option B

You don't want to pay for postage.  Just keep the thing for yourselves.

***

## A

PAY 5 COLLECTIVE GOLD:  Sure enough, undere the floorboards of his old room, you find a bunch of
parts, tools, and an intricately crafted metal spider.  You package it up and ship it off to the
Tinkerer.  Anything for an old friend.
