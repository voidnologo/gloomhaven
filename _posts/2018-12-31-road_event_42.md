A trade cravan passes by you on the road.  This event isn't too uncommon, but what catches your eye
is a familiar looking Inox traveling with the caravan as a guard.

At the sight of you, the Brute lights up and gives you a big wave, then rushes over to greet you.  He
is positively filled with joy to see you and immediately starts to reminisce about all the exciting
battles you fought together.

Slapping you on the back, he implores you to travel with the caravan for a while to give you all
a chance to catch up.


## Option A

Agree to travel with the Brute for a little while.  So what if it's in the wrong direction?

## Option B

Regretfully leave the Brute to his duties and continue on your way.

***

## A

As you walk with the Brute and talk with him about your early adventuring days, you find a hint of
sadness behind his enthusiasm.  He explains how he fell on hard times after leaving the group and
had to resort to jobs like this to make ends meet.  The Brute seems uplifted by your conversation,
but the day grows late.  By the time you head back and arrive at your destination, you are incredibly
tired.
