Anticipating an enjoyable night of drinks at the Sleepling Lion, you enter the tavern to see a
familiar Savvas sitting at your usual table.  The Cragheart stands and extends both its arms.

"Ah, friends! So good to see you," it says.  "Sit! Have a drink with me!"

## Option A

Have a drink with the Cragheart.

## Option B

Encourage the Cragheart to move on with its life.

***

## A

One drink turns into five, and five turns into even more.  It is a great night of revelry at the
Sleeping Lion.  You see sadness in the Cragheart's eyes when you finally stand up to leave.  It
tells you it's been hard to find people to relate to since leaving the party and it thanks you
for your continual friendship.
