## The Toxic Moor
{: .gloomfont}

Scooty took a tentative sip of her drink, dodging one of Sir Integral’s wildly gesturing hands
instinctively. He was perched on the edge of the table at The N-agon, recounting their adventure in
the Temple of the Seer to the slowly growing crowd gathered around him. Although he usually managed
to contain this excitement when he shared the stories of their adventures, something about their
latest quest had him more excited than usual. He was talking louder and faster than he normally did,
and his gestures, usually small and infrequent, had become large and almost constant.

“And then we opened the door, and there were *drakes*. Giant red flying *drakes*. As soon as the
door opened, those rascals flew straight at us.” His hands zoomed to the left, showing the motion of
the drakes. “We were so distracted by the drakes that we didn’t even see the bears until it was
almost too late. Great big lumbering bears!” He flung his arms out as wide as he could, presumably
trying to represent the size of the bears, and Blockingjay ducked out of the way with a scowl. “They
were running straight for us, but Scooty didn’t even see them! She saw the spirits in the corner and
jumped right into the fray, swinging her axe.” He pantomimed swinging a great axe. “But of course
Blockingjay didn’t want to be outdone, so he jumped in next to her and shoved a spirit into a trap,
and don’t ask me how that worked, it defies all logic…”

“Where shall we adventure next?” Scooty asked Master Ratchet and Blockingjay quietly, not wanting to
take the crowd’s attention from Sir Integral.

“I’ve heard rumors of a great tree with healing properties.” Master Ratchet rubbed his hands
together, his eyes gleaming. “It lies in the heart of the Lingering Swamp, to the south. I am very
interested in collecting samples from it…”

Blockingjay shrugged. “Doesn’t sound terribly interesting to me. I would much rather go find the
Lost Island that the temple told us about. Great wealth is far preferable to *samples*…”

“There’s no reason we can’t do both.” Scooty ducked one of Sir Integral’s gestures. “It’s likely
that we can get passage from the swamp to the island. And collecting a sample from the tree shouldn’t
take very long at all.”

Blockingjay grunted and took another handful of popcorn from the bowl at the center of the table. “I
guess that would be fine,” he mumbled before throwing the entire handful in his mouth.

[INSERT ROAD EVENT]

————

Mud sucked at Scooty and Blockingjay’s feet as they stumbled through the swamp. Master Ratchet seemed
to be light enough that the mud didn’t affect him at all, and Sir Integral, not wanting to get his
shoes dirty, had opted to float along above the ground instead. They had been trudging through the
muck for hours, heading towards what they hoped was the center of the swamp. Scooty resisted the urge
to grumble about how ruined her boots would be and thought instead how glad she was that she had
stored her winged shoes in her pack for the journey. *Maybe the mud is what lingers in the Lingering
Swamp…*

“Gracious me, is that smoke?!”

Sir Integral’s question pulled Scooty’s thoughts away from the terrible mud, and she looked up to see
a cloud of smoke coming from over the next hill. It was small, but it appeared to be growing as she watched.

“It’s the tree!” squealed Master Ratchet as he broke into a run. Sir Integral started to float faster,
holding his top hat on his head with one hand. Scooty could barely make out Blockingjay’s grumbling
as she ran after her friends, hoping desperately that she wouldn’t lose her boots to the mud.

The group finally crested the hill to witness a terrible sight. Amidst poisonous waters, the giant
tree stood ablaze, apparently the source of the dark smoke. A number of drakes and other dark creatures
scurried around it.

“It’s a mating ritual.” Scooty turned to see an old Inox woman approaching them, her eyes wide with
panic. “I’ve seen it up north. The drakes burn down trees as a show of their strength, but…but that
tree is sacred. Please, you must do something! If the tree dies, my village will have no way to
sustain itself.”

Blockingjay’s eyes filled with pain at the sight of the old woman. He charged in the direction of
the tree with a great roar, swinging his blade menacingly in front of him, followed by the others.
One drake emerged from the group of creatures to stand between the heroes and the rest of the
creatures, an arrogant gleam in his eye. The group stopped short as a black imp, another drake, and
a giant viper drew up behind the first drake.

“You vile creatures! We will smite thee with all the powers vested in us by the fact that we are
kick-butt, super powerful-“

Sir Integral was cut short when the first drake leapt towards them, claws extended. The black imp
behind him spat in their direction; the fluid sizzled wherever it touched skin. The adventurers
huddled a little closer together as they did their best to brush off the liquid, unsure of how to
proceed.

“Brave comrades!” Sir Integral stood tall, the first to regain his composure. “We shall fight these-“
The drake advanced another step, swiping with his claws, and was knocked back by a blow from
Blockingjay’s shield. “-these no-good, stinking, vermin.” He extended one long finger towards the
drake. “Your mama was probably a viler critter than you are!”

“Fight towards the tree!” Blockingjay called, pushing the drake backward with a flurry of blows
from his sword. Master Ratchet threw some kind of potion into the air as the group pressed forward,
and the foul liquid seemed to melt off. Scooty reached out her hands and drew up three pillars of
earth from the ground, creating a barrier between the first drake and Blockingjay and between the
black imp and the rest of the group. Tossing orbs of various sizes and colors in the general
direction of the enemies, Sir Integral stalked forward menacingly.

As the first two drakes fell to Blockingjay’s sword, a living corpse and a second black imp emerged
from the smoke. The imp spat more foul liquid as the corpse shuffled forward. Scooty leaped forward,
pulling the Skullbane Axe from its place attached to her pack, and swung, killing the corpse with a
single blow. She summoned chunks of dirt with her off hand and threw them at the second imp as she
rehung the axe. She turned and hacked at the viper behind her, the sounds of the first dying imp
finally reaching her ears.

“We can make it!” she called back to her friends. “Just a little further!”

Blockingjay sliced the head off the viper behind her as he came forward. The four adventurers
pressed forward together, fighting side-by-side against the dark creatures. Despite the imminent
danger, Scooty smiled as she axed another living corpse and flung a hunk of dirt at another imp.

The group broke through the thickest of the smoke to find themselves faced by a solid mass of
creatures. Scooty threw down her winged shoes and slipped into them, then jumped over the group and
swung her axe at the two living corpses bringing up the rear. The tree was still engulfed in flames,
though they were smaller now that the drakes were otherwise occupied. Blockingjay hacked through the
center of the group. Master Ratchet followed closely, firing off bolts when he could and releasing
various potions into the air. Sir Integral, his eyes focused on a chest half-buried in the muck on
the other side of the tree, darted quickly past all of them.

The creatures fell quickly around the heroes, falling into the foul water with dull splashes as they
did. Sir Integral rejoined the Quatryl, the Savvas, and the Inox a short distance from the tree. The
y all gazed up at it in awe as the last of the blazes died out and the smoke started to clear. The
tree was already beginning to regenerate, its bark turning various shades of dark greens and light
browns, its leaves glowing a brilliant light green. Master Ratchet and Blockingjay approached the
tree almost reverently. Master Ratchet gently took small samples of the bark, stowing them in a
glass jar he had produced from his pack, while Blockingjay reached up and carefully plucked a few of
the leaves.

“I cannot thank you enough for what you have done, strangers.” Scooty turned to see the old Inox
woman standing next to her. “I don’t know why you showed up when you did, but I believe it was the
work of the spirits. You are a miracle!”

“The pleasure is all ours, ma’am,” Sir Integral replied, removing his top hat and bowing grandly.
“It is the sacred duty of brave heroes such as ourselves to interfere in the lives of those less
fortunate than ourselves. Since the dawn of time, it has fallen to those with superior skills and
intellect to come to the aid of-”

“I cannot fathom what would cause drakes to travel so far south, though.” The woman scratched her
head thoughtfully and continued as though she hadn’t interrupted Sir Integral’s speech. “Perhaps
there is something working against the spirits as well. In any case, please take these as a token of
my thanks.” She placed a couple of potions into Scooty’s hands. “My tribe extracts the healing
powers of the tree to make them. I hope they are of some use to you.”

“We are very grateful,” Scooty replied, stowing the potions in her pack. “As Sir Integral said,
we’re always happy to help.”

The old woman smiled and walked back in the direction of her village. Master Ratchet and
Blockingjay, having collected all the samples the Quatryl could desire, returned to their teammates.

“Onward?” Blockingjay rumbled.

Sir Integral solemnly nodded his agreement. “Onward.”
