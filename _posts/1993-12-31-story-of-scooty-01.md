## Runaway
{: .gloomfont}

The world was silent as Erecura slipped as quietly as she could through the underground city.
The Savvas girl gripped the straps of her knapsack tightly as she stole along the stone walkways,
occasionally glancing over each shoulder. The dimness of the sleeping city reassured her that no
one had noticed her absence yet.

Deciding to run hadn’t been easy. Even as she laid the note that she had tearfully labored over for
hours on the kitchen table, Erecura had found her hands shaking. She knew that leaving as she was -
in the middle of the night, without express permission from her assigned mentors - meant that she
could never return. She would be shunned by Savvas everywhere, whether she was caught and shattered
or not.

*But it would be worse if they found out.*

Erecura shoved the thought down, taking a shaky breath. They would never find out now. They would
never know what happened that night, when she snuck back home tear-stained and breathing raggedly…

Something thudded softly behind her, echoing eerily off the stone walls around her, and Erecura
picked up her pace. There would be time to sort out her emotions when she was far away from here.

She was two steps from the door when she realized that she could see her shadow on the wall in
front of her. She chanced a look back to see far too many torches lighting up the walkways. Not
concerned about making any noise now, she started to run.

The pre-dawn world seemed eerily peaceful as Erecura sprinted through the forest. A soft breeze
blew sleepily through the trees, the leaves rustling gently. Her footsteps were nearly silent,
thanks to a childhood spent running through the forest. She could hear running from inside the
cave now; the mob must not be concerned about waking the sleeping city. If she could just make it
out of the forest, the superstitious Savvas would never follow her.

“Erecura!”

The Savvas girl glanced over her shoulder to see that the mob was outside the cave now. Natae and
Casseus, the mentors who had trained her, led the group, torches in hand. Hearing the anger and
accusation in Natae’s voice, Erecura could feel anger and hatred stir deep within her. She pressed
on, now able to see the world beyond the trees.

She stopped at the edge of the forest, her chest heaving, the first light of the rising sun just
beginning to bleed over the mountains behind her. The light of the mob’s torches flickered as they
came to a stop behind her, casting eerie shadows across their faces.

"Erecura." Natae stepped forward from the group, looking much too put together for having been
woken up in the middle of the night. "Stop this. Come back to the city."

Erecura's eyes scanned the mob before her as she struggled to catch her breath. Casseus cowered
behind Natae, too weak to face her himself. A new wave of anger and disgust washed over her, and a
sudden gust of wind blew through the trees, extinguishing the Savvas' torches. Their surprised
faces were now lit only by the energy cores glowing in their chests.

Without a word, Erecura reached up and rested her hand on her chest. Dim green light spilled out
between her fingers. Taking one steadying breath, she plunged her hand into her chest. There
was the sound of shattering glass, followed by a hollow thud as a glowing green orb hit the ground
and started to roll. Erecura watched, expressionless, as her energy core - the manifestation of her
power, the mark of her success as a Savvas - rolled down the hill, stopping with a light *thump*
at Natae's feet.

"Fool," Natae hissed. "Do you know what you've done? Without your energy core, you are *nothing*.
Now you are cursed, and forever exiled from your people."

"Then let me be cursed." Erecura turned from the Savvas, setting her gaze upon where the sun was
rising behind the mountains, and ran.
