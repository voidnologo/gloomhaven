You see a lone man walking toward you on the road.  As you meet on the path, he turns to you
and begins to speak.

"Oi there, I wouldn't suppose you lot might spare me some coin?" he asks.  "A lot of coin, actually."

You look at him quizzically as he continues.  "You see, I lead a lotta theives and bandits in this area
and we gotta make sure all the mouths are fed."

At this, a large number of bandits come out of hiding around you, emerging from the bushes.

"So, about that coin", the man says with a smile.  "FIve gold per head oughta do it."


## Option A

Pay the theives

## Option B

Resist the robbery, killing as many theives as you can.

***

## B

Unfazed by the ambush, you draw your weapons and attack the bandits in the bushes.  The
leader tries to withdraw, but you cut him down as well.  There are a lot of bandits, but
they don't put up too much of a fight.  They seem weak and malnourished.  You guess the
leader wasn't kidding about needing to buy food.

<strong>All start scenario with 3 damage.</strong><br>
