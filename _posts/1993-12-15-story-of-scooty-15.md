## The Necromancer's Sanctum
{: .gloomfont}

Scooty burst through the door, fists at the ready, only to find a mostly empty room. Her eyes lit
up as she saw that, in the middle of the room, surrounded by small piles of glinting gold, lay
a chest. Brushing past the one reanimated corpse that lurked just inside the door, she rushed to
the chest and dropped to her knees before it, hardly daring to breathe. Could this really be it?
Could this really be the holy axe she had been searching for?

Scooty held her breath, opening the lid of the chest ever-so-slowly. Unable to bear the suspense
any longer, she flung the lid the rest of the way open and gasped when she saw what lay inside.

On a bed of black velvet rested a [INSERT DESCRIPTION] axe. She lifted it gingerly, not quite
ready to believe that she had finally found what she had been searching for. It was much lighter
than it looked, but she could feel the power flowing out of it. She stood up slowly, cradling the
object of her redemption in both hands.

A small shuffle and a low groan reminded Scooty that she was not alone. She whirled around to see
the corpse she had rushed past ambling clumsily towards her, his mouth hanging open, his head
tilted at an unnatural angle. Scooty smirked as she broke into a run, raising the axe above her
head. A dull glow emanated from the axe, faint at first, but steadily growing stronger as she drew
closer to the enemy. With one swing of the axe, Scooty cleaved the monster in half at the waist.
A squishing thud reached her ears as she ran back into the main corridor to regroup with her
comrades.

"I found it!" she gasped as she skidded to a stop next to Sir Integral. The Orchid threw two
fireballs into the next room with a wicked grin as Scooty gulped down a few stabilizing breaths.
"I found the axe!"

Sir Integral whooped loudly, punching a fist into the air in his excitement, before remembering
himself. "That does sound wonderful, m'dear," he drawled, adjusting the angle of his top hat with
delicate fingers before shooting bolts of mana into the slowly approaching mass of corpses and
skeletons. "But if it's not too much trouble, would you mind terribly *using it*?"

Scooty blinked once, still not quite used to Sir Integral's many personality quirks. Then she
turned and swung the axe into the nearest skeleton, watching with satisfaction as it fell apart,
forming a scattered pile of bones at her feet. Looking up, she noticed that Master Ratchet crouched
a short distance behind Sir Integral, shooting restorative mist into the air as often as his busily
whirring tools would allow. He held one injured arm close to his body. Blockingjay, starting to
back away from the doorway, was bleeding from multiple wounds and bites, apprehension just starting
to creep into his eyes. Sir Integral didn't appear to be injured but looked fatigued; his usually
crisp suit was beginning to look rumpled and dirty. Scooty quickly formed a ball of earth and
tossed it into the room. It hit one of the bigger corpses in the chest, knocking him backwards into
a trap. He staggered where he stood, a dazed expression on his face. More corpses and bones filed
around him, coming from both sides to fill the newly-emptied space.

"There are too many!" Blockingjay bellowed, swinging his sword with all the force he could muster.
Scooty couldn't even see Jekserah through the crowd of undead.

"Alas!  We are nigh unto being vanquished!  I pray thee, let us withdraw for the moment so we can
reestablish ourselves to become victorious!" Sir Integral glared at the nearest enemies, then
turned on his heel, arrogant as ever, and began to saunter away. He cast a sidelong glance at
Scooty, and once he had attained eye contact, began making small shooing motions in front of him.

"Shoo, shoo, come on, let's get out of here," he hissed out of the corner of his mouth. "Move it!"

Master Ratchet started to scamper away as quickly as his tiny frame allowed. Scooty and Blockingjay
turned together and started to race after the Quatryl as Sir Integral wheeled around, pulling
himself up to his tallest, and angrily pointed at the skeleton in the doorway. "You, yeah, YOU!
Thou odorous pile of putrid filth, I'll get you!  When I come back, *FIRE AND DOOM* on you and
all your measly little friends!" Scooty heard a high-pitched squeal and stopped to look back. Sir
Integral was standing still, a look of horror on his face. Scooty could just see the precious top
hat being trampled under the feet of the corpses that were slowly shambling towards him. Sir
Integral quickly regained his composure and shouted, "My hat! You Wretched little Turd Sack, why
when I ..." After barely dodging the swinging arm of the nearest corpse, the Orchid scampered
backwards, limbs flailing, and turned to run alongside the others. "What are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to *move*!""
